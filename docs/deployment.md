# Deployment

Sativa OS is deployed as a Cloudflare-native ledger MVP.

## Runtime

- Cloudflare Worker: serves the React/Vite static frontend assets, JSON APIs, and MCP tool endpoints.
- Cloudflare D1: stores accounts, businesses, ledger categories, ledger transactions, reports, reflections, and generic entries.
- Browser cache: React pages read `localStorage` first for instant repeat loads, then refresh from Cloudflare D1 in the background. The BMC stores structured BMC blocks per business in browser cache and D1.
- Auth: intentionally disabled for the current functional test deployment.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm run db:migrate:remote
npm run deploy
```

## Seeded current facts

- Salary: Rp2,000,000 cash in.
- Bank admin spare: Rp25,000 cash out.
- GoPay: Rp12,000 spendable wallet balance.
- WARAS: Rp1,000,000 out of free cash and tracked as WARAS asset in Sonny's empty bank account.
- WARAS ownership: Adit 65%, Sonny 35%.
- Savings: Rp0.

## Next hardening step

Add PIN/session auth before putting more sensitive private operating data into D1.

## 2026-06-27 performance correction

- Read-only API routes no longer await seed/upsert work before returning JSON. This avoids slow refreshes such as 15s mission-control loads.
- The React frontend removed the heavy tldraw user flow and uses a static nine-block BMC editor with browser cache and per-block D1 persistence.
- Navigation is simplified: the Sativa OS title is the home link, `+transaction` is next to the title, and MCP Manifest is in the top menu.

## ChatGPT Create an App values

Use these values for the no-auth test connection:

- Name: `Sativa OS`
- Description: `Private operating system for ledger, cashflow, projects, weekly review, OKRs, and business model control.`
- Connection: Server URL
- Server URL: `https://sativa-os.praditya-bagus.workers.dev/mcp`
- Authentication: `No authentication` if available. OAuth is not implemented yet.

After the app connects, ask ChatGPT to call `get_money_situation`, `list_accounts`, `get_weekly_review`, or `get_business_model_canvas`.

## Ledger control MCP tools

The no-auth MCP endpoint now exposes ledger control tools beyond add/list: update/reclassify/void/delete transaction, record transfer, split transaction, notes, receipts, account reconciliation, account/category/business management, spending summaries, recurring expense checks, tax/export/import/bulk cleanup, and audit-log reads. All mutations write to `ledger_audit_log`; voided/deleted rows are excluded from balances by default.
